scanning the map and the track building process, a map could have multiple tracks.

- i will end the stage of building new map at the point of finishing scanning, arter that i will make a stage that saves the map.
- i will make a stage that is called build track, where you can edit existing map file by building track
- when picking existing maps to be loaded or trying to edit existing map the map is first synced with the robot with zero position, and 
  the user is asked to confirm the robot position by clicking on the dislayed map, an initial position is displayed whcih is 
  saved with the map file, if the map file does not contain the home position the user is required to chose position. the position is selected
  as arrow selection. the user then can press
  update postion which will sync the robot postion, then the user is allowed either to continue, or to update it again.
- finally after selecting the pose this pose is udated as the current pose and the charging pose behind it by 15cm.
  
- a map directory should contain 2 essential files, pgm or stm file, a home_pose.txt file, and could contain non or serveral .track files
- track files storing the x,y poses of the track seperated by & and poses are seperated by |.

tasks
 - end creating enw map stage at the scanning point
 - create the saving map mechanism save map with the home pose and angle
 - create new stage for building tracks on existing maps
 - create map current pose and home pose confirmation page, where you select pose and confirm that robot is placed here.
